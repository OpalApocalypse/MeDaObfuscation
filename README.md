# Meta Data Obfuscation Tool

Concept: To randomize all possible meta-data of any file within certain folder parameters. For the sake of this concept it will only be in the Downloads folder and will save the original name in a database, replacing it with the hash value using MD5. Although the odds of a hash collision are incredibly low and for a personal use of this software certainly are beyond the odds of ever occurring, a safety feature will be added to this using windows default duplicate file name suggestions to add (1) and so on after the fact.
